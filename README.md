Long ago in an R-Universe far, far away...

This isn't the repo you are looking for.

## Contributing

But if you really are looking for this one, you're in the right spot!

If you are a member of AAGI-AUS who has created an R package and would like to add it to the AAGI-AUS R-Universe, edit the [packages.json](https://github.com/AAGI-AUS/aagi-aus.r-universe.dev/blob/main/packages.json) file to add the lines for your new package.
The packages.json file requires you to provide the package name as in the DESCRIPTION file and the URL to the repository.
You can do this locally on your own computer or in your browser via the GitHub editor interface.
Once you've committed your changes, that's it, R-Universe will do the rest when it checks for any changes and will build and deploy your package within the hour.
